Introduction
This document provides an excessively detailed, step by step method for building
a desktop PC from scratch. It assumes you have purchased all necessary parts and
tools. Nothing is glossed over. Every screw, cable, and precaution is documented.

Tools and Materials
1. Phillips #2 screwdriver (magnetized preferred)
2. Anti static wrist strap (ESD strap)
3. Small bowl(s) or magnetic tray for screws
4. Thermal paste (if not pre applied)
5. Isopropyl alcohol (90%+) and lint free cloth (for cleaning)
6. Cable ties (nylon and reusable velcro)
7. Flashlight or headlamp (for visibility inside case)
8. Your components:
   Case
   Power Supply Unit (PSU)
   Motherboard (mobo)
   CPU (Processor)
   CPU Cooler
   Memory (RAM)
   Storage (SSD, HDD, NVMe)
   Graphics Card (GPU)
   Case fans (if not pre installed)
   Peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse)

Step 1: Preparation
Work on a large, clean, flat surface.
Wear your anti static strap clipped to a grounded surface.
Lay out each component and confirm part numbers.
Consult the motherboard manual. Keep it open throughout build.

Step 2: Case Preparation
Remove both side panels. Store screws safely.
Lay case on its side with motherboard tray facing upward.
Check standoff alignment: compare to mobo mounting holes.
Adjust or add standoffs as needed (never overtighten).

Step 3: Power Supply Installation
Confirm PSU orientation: fan intake should face a vent (case bottom or rear).
Slide PSU into position, secure with 4 screws at rear.
Pre route PSU cables through case cutouts: 24 pin ATX, 8 pin CPU, PCIe, SATA.

Step 4: Motherboard Assembly (outside case)
Place mobo on cardboard box or anti static foam.
Open CPU socket lever carefully.
Align CPU triangle with socket triangle, gently lower in. Do not force.
Lock socket arm until it clicks (expect firm resistance).

Step 5: CPU Cooler
If cooler has pre applied paste, skip paste application.
If not, apply pea sized dot of paste at CPU center.
Secure cooler brackets to mobo according to instructions.
Tighten screws in diagonal pattern, a few turns at a time.

Step 6: RAM Installation
Consult manual for dual channel slots (usually A2 and B2).
Open DIMM slot latches fully.
Align notch in RAM with slot key.
Press firmly until latches click shut.

Step 7: M.2 SSD Installation (if applicable)
Locate M.2 slot on mobo.
Remove tiny screw and set aside.
Insert NVMe at 30 degree angle, gently press down, secure screw.

Step 8: Install Motherboard in Case
Insert rear I/O shield into case until it clicks (metal edges inward).
Lower mobo into case, align I/O ports with shield.
Align standoffs with screw holes.
Secure mobo with included screws (do not overtighten).

Step 9: Case Fans
Install intake fans at front, exhaust at rear or top.
Confirm airflow direction (arrows on side of fans).
Secure with provided screws. Connect to SYS FAN headers.

Step 10: GPU Installation
Remove PCIe slot covers corresponding to GPU width.
Insert GPU into top PCIe x16 slot. Push until latch clicks.
Secure with screws to case bracket.

Step 11: Storage Drives (2.5 or 3.5)
Mount SSDs in 2.5 bays with screws or trays.
Mount HDDs in 3.5 bays with vibration damping screws if possible.
Connect SATA data cable to mobo, SATA power cable to PSU.

Step 12: Cable Connections
24 pin ATX to motherboard main power.
8 pin CPU power near top of mobo.
PCIe power connectors to GPU.
SATA power to drives.
Front panel connectors (PWR SW, RESET, HDD LED, PWR LED) to header (consult manual).
Front panel audio, USB 2.0 or 3.0 headers to mobo.
Fan headers to SYS FAN or CHA FAN.

Step 13: Cable Management
Route cables behind motherboard tray where possible.
Use cable ties to bundle excess.
Avoid obstructing fans or airflow.

Step 14: Initial Power On Test
Connect monitor, keyboard, mouse.
Plug PSU into wall, switch to ON.
Press case power button.
Confirm fans spin, LEDs light, and monitor displays POST or BIOS screen.

Step 15: BIOS Setup
Enter BIOS (Del or F2).
Confirm CPU, RAM, storage detected.
Set boot priority to USB for OS installation.
Enable XMP for RAM if supported.

Step 16: Operating System Installation
Insert bootable USB.
Follow OS install prompts.
Install chipset, GPU, and driver software as instructed.
