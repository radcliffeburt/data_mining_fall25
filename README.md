# PLEASE READ TO GRADE FOR CODE REVIEW 3
work from data mining in fall 2025

Due to the mess that my repo sits, this will serve as a legend for going through it:

1. pre trained weights - " (gpt2-124M-thelostrace-sft.pth)"
2. fine tuned weights on instructions regarding the model: "gpt2-124M-thelostrace-instruction-summary-sft.pth"
3. notebook containing pre training is pre_trained_personal_gpt2.ipynb
4. notebook containing fine tuning is personal_training_gpt2.ipynb
5. Personally made softmax function - /old_unused_code/softmax_func.ipynb

6. from the book classification/instruction training: gpt2_classifier.ipynb / gpt2_instructions.ipynb
